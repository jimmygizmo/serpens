interesing sidenote:
dmesg - what use has it from within a container? Anyhow on this CentOS, it seems there is a setting
preventing access.

[root@d74eeaa1b0ec /]# dmesg
dmesg: read kernel buffer failed: Operation not permitted
[root@d74eeaa1b0ec /]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict
1

If access is given, it might be showing info for the parent host, not the container, which is
reported as common. This is an area to learn more about
