Root does not pick up the environment like regular users and so the normal Pyenv installation
process is hitting a very small snag at the end when it is needed to 'source' the .profile
script of the user to pick up and run a few small lines added there.
This is to 'init' Pyenv.

As the root user in the Docker context, this is the error we hit when trying"
source ~/.bashrc

I have tried using .bashrc. Same results as using .profile. (root has both by default on this Ubuntu)
root@e4ac5b75f1fa:/# ls -alt /root/
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 May 21 19:16 .pyenv
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 May 21 19:16 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3248 May 21 13:54 .bashrc
drwx------ 1 root root 4096 May 21 13:29 .
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  161 Dec  5  2019 .profile

And notice we installed Pyenv into ~/.pyenv which is standard although it is usally for a normal
user, not root in a container.

Making the additions and the sourcing either gave the same error.

su -l did not work for picking up the changes either.

Next trying direct execution of the command within the conditional, but not sure this will work.
If it does work initially, then I'm not sure it will work for all possible scenarios within
then container, if for instance a new shell was spawned. But it is worth a try.

Trying manual execution to init Pyenv like this:
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
======================================================================
UPDATE: Actually, when using .bashrc, a NEW SHELL DOES HAVE WORKING PYENV. EXTERNAL SHELL FROM DOCKER RUN.
The failure is during the build.
TODO: Validate this finding using .profile and see if it is same/different.
