CentOS Serpens:  A Python-centric Dev/Build Dockerfile. Heavyweight version for development, building or specialized testing or troubleshooting. Lightweight version for a cost-optimized (small) professional-grade (tools-equipped) production image. Python is best-in-class, using Pyenv and Pyenv-virtualenv for professional-grade version management and environment encapsulation.
