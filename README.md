# serpens
Ubuntu Serpens:  A Python-centric Dev/Build Dockerfile.
Heavyweight 'Dev' version for development, building, specialized testing or troubleshooting. Lightweight 'Live' version for a cost-optimized (small) professional-grade (tools-equipped) production image. The Python is best-in-class, using Pyenv and Pyenv-Virtualenv for a professional-grade Python installation and library version management and environment encapsulation.
