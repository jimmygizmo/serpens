TRY THIS FOR PYENV INIT ROOT SOURCE PROBLEM.
FROM:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/20953/sudo-source-command-not-found

It doesn't work because source is a built in command, not a program. I wrote a bash script to force sudo on built in commands:

#!/bin/bash

function forceSudo()
{
    command="${@}"
    file="${@: -1}"
    if ! $command 2>/dev/null
    then
        permission=$(stat -c '%a' $file)
        sudo chmod o+rx $file
        result=$command 2>/dev/null
        sudo chmod $permission $file
        if ! $result
        then
            echo $result
        fi
    fi
}
Save the file as forceSudo and save it in your scripts location, possibly ~/.local/bin. To avoid having to source the file before using the function, add alias forceSudo='unalias forceSudo && . forceSudo && forceSudo "$@"' to ~/.bashrc.

Now you can use forceSudo source /etc/bash.bashrc.
